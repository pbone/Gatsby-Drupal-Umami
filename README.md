# Using Drupal

https://using-drupal.gatsbyjs.org

Example site that demonstrates how to build Gatsby sites that pull data from the
[Drupal CMS](https://www.drupal.org/).


This is my fork because I couldn't get https://gatsbyguides.com/tutorial/what-gatsby to work.

Clone this repo:

  ```shell
    cd using-drupal
    npm install
    gatsby develop
```

(this is pre-set to pull Drupal data from: https://using-drupal.amazee.io/`,)
